I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms of my learning as a software engineer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.',
    'Ive decided to start taking a more consistent approach to creating games, so will be uploading them in a section of this portfolio',
